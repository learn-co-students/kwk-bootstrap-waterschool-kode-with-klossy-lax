# Swarovski Homepage Redesign

## Objectives

1. Practice using bootstrap
2. Build a website based off of a mock up.

## Instructions

The Swarovski Waterschool team is re-doing their marketing materials, including their website. Their designers have been hard at work creating a new, beautiful landing page for the program. Your task is to translate the mockup provided by the designers in to a functional landing page. Use your bootstrap skills to build the website structure, and then add custom CSS to see how close you can get to the mockup provided in the homepage-mockup.jpg image in this repository.

Good Luck!
